[.step]
- What happened? _Descriptive_
- Why did it happen? _Diagnostic_
- What will happen? _Predictive_
- What should I do? _Prescriptive_

Analytics: transforming data into insights for making better decisions.
[%step]
* Data -> Insight -> Action

[background-video="./stars.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
== Cognitive & Analytics

Is Cognitive Computing another layer _on top_ of the existing
analytics ones?

[background-video="./stars.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
== Cognitive systems are different

[.step]
* They create deeper _human engagement_.
* They scale and elevate _expertise_.
* They infuse products and services with _cognition_.
* They _enable cognitive processes_ and operations.
* They enhance _exploration and discovery_.

== Cognitive systems

«...This platform must encompass machine learning, reasoning, natural
language processing, speech and vision, human-computer interaction,
dialog and narrative generation and more...»

== Cognitive

* Data -> Information -> Knowledge


[background-video="./stars.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
== Cognitive computing

[%step]
* _extends_ analytics.
*  is able to consume and interpret _unstructured data_.
* addresses _ambiguous_ problems
* interacts naturally with humans

=== *Programming* vs. *educating*.

== Watson: from concepts to outcomes

IBM *Watson for Genomics* helps analyze a patient’s tumor's
  genomicdata by providing information on potential therapeutic
  options with supporting evidence.

[background-video="./stars.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
== Making sense of unstructured data

[.step]
* *Watson for Oncology* _consumes_ the growing body of medical
  literature, guidelines, trials, articles, and patient data,
  _interprets_ medical records and _suggests_ potential treatments.

[background-video="./stars.mp4",options="loop,muted"]
== Cognitive search

IBM *Watson Discovery* service to adds cognitive search and content
analytics engine to applications to identify patterns, trends and
actionable insights that drive better decision-making.

== Watson Analytics

Watson Analytics is a smart data analysis and visualization service
you can use to quickly discover patterns and meaning in your data –
all on your own. With guided data discovery, automated predictive
analytics and cognitive capabilities such as natural language
dialogue, you can interact with data conversationally to get answers
you understand.
